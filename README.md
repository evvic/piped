## Pipes Game

Drop from one pipe and rotate the "controller" to fall into the next pipe! The MEMS data from the MPU gyroscope controlls the movement!

_The pipes continue to get smaller upon every sequential connection!_

## Wiring
The wiring combined the wiring diagrams of the [`lcd`](/lcd/) and [`mems`](/mems/) folders. The two diagrams do not overlap with using any pins so they can easily be combined.

### SPI
The LCD uses SPI for sending the pixel draw data via MOSI digital pinout ~11

### I2C
The MPU uses I2C for specifying the device and querying its registers for accelerometer data via SDA pinout

## Software
The [`level-jump`](/level-jump/) folder contains the code for running the game, based on the wiring schematics mentioned above
